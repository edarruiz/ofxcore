There are no dedicated developers for this project, so development is entirely based on voluntary effort. I am working on this project in my spare time, whenever my work schedule and business projects allow me to do so.

If you are interested on this project, you can contribute as well. 

Here are some guidelines concerning contributions:
- All contributions should be done on <code>contrib</code>.
- <code>main</code> is only for **PR** and stable code roadmap.
- Every pull request should preferably be linked to a GitHub issue.
- Write unit tests, if applicable.
- Don't be afraid to suggest any changes that can help the goal of this SDK. New ideas are always welcome!
