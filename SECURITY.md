# Security Policy
If a security vulnerability is found, we undertake to make the necessary corrections and apply them as quickly as possible in the available versions.

## Supported Versions
All versions available on releases of OFX SDK support security policy. 

If any version or release for any reason does not support security policy any longer, the version numbers, releases and reasons will be listed below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Security issues should be reported privately to the project owner by sending a private message via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericrda/)

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your
